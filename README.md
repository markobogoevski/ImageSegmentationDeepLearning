# Image Segmentation deep learning

This repository accumulates code for the implementation of various often used deep learning models regarding the problem of semantic image segmentation. It offers pre-trained models (DeepLab, SegNet and pix2pix) on three repositories alongside the correposponding results folders. The repository also holds a console application where the model SegNet is used to predict a query image from the CamVid dataset.
