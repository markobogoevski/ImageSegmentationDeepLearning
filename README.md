# Image Segmentation deep learning

This repository accumulates code for the implementation of various often used deep learning models regarding the problem of semantic image segmentation. The repository holds a console application where the model SegNet is used to predict a query image from the CamVid dataset alongisde all the notebooks which were used to generate the results, preprocess the datasets and train the models.
