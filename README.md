# Image Segmentation deep learning

This repository accumulates code for the implementation of various often used deep learning models regarding the problem of semantic image segmentation. The repository holds a console application where the model SegNet is used to predict a query image from the CamVid dataset alongisde all the notebooks which were used to generate the results, preprocess the datasets and train the models.

*** There was no way to insert the model due to its size, so a video of the application is provided alongside the code, but the .py file won't work because the model isn't imported.
